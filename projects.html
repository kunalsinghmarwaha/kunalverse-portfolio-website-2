          <p>Chillax is a personalized entertainment website created by me, inspired by the concept of a Netflix
            clone but featuring its own unique content. The platform offers a sleek, user-friendly design, with 
            vibrant show boxes displaying titles and images curated to enhance the browsing experience. It also includes
            essential sections like FAQ, Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and a Help Center to provide comprehensive support for users.
            With an integrated subscription page, Chillax ensures a seamless user experience, reflecting Kunal's creativity and dedication <br>
            to building engaging digital solutions.</p>
